#### The Calm app is the perfect app for when that loved one or close friend is rushed to the hospital or emergency room.

### Steps to use Calm App
When you open the calm app you will be presented with three choices. The choices are "Checklist", "Notify" and "Hospital". The checklist tab shows you items that you need to pack and allows you to mark them off when you have packed them. The notify tab allows the user to send a pre-written text message or email. All the user has to do is change the blanks in the message to your information. The hospital tab allows the user to search a city and will be given a map with markers of the closest hospitals in that city. If a marker is clicked then the hospitals information is shown. The information provided is: name, address, website, phone number.

### Who is this for?
This app is built for the first responder or closest family member to the one being rushed to the hospital. It is meant to put their mind at ease and focus on the person who needs the care.

### Future of Calm
1. Hoping to add a way for the user of Calm to travel to the hospital by the click of a button. I am looking to integrate the Uber API.
2. I would like to make the app a little more personal with having an account and login screen.
3. Document Storage, in the future I hope the calm app is a place where the user can store their will, health care directive and medical records.
