### Steps to use Calm App
When you open the calm app you will be presented with three choices. The choices are "Checklist", "Notify" and "Hospital". The checklist tab shows you items that you need to pack and allows you to mark them off when you have packed them. The notify tab allows the user to send a pre-written text message or email. All the user has to do is change the blanks in the message to your information. The hospital tab allows the user to search a city and will be given a map with markers of the closest hospitals in that city. If a marker is clicked then the hospitals information is shown. The information provided is: name, address, website, phone number.
