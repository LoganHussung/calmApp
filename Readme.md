**#Calm **
#### The Calm app is the perfect app for when that loved one or closed friend is rushed to the hospital or emergency room.

#### Steps to use Calm App
When you open the calm app you will be presented with three choices. The choices are Checklist, Notify and Hospital. The checklist tab shows you items that you need to pack and allows you to mark them off when you have packed them. The notify tab allows the user to send a pre-written text message or email. All the user has to do is change the blanks in the message to your information.
